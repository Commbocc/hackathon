Hillsborough County is opening up data from numerous departments to Tampa Bayâ€™s technology community and is offering prizes for the best apps built on top of the data.

Powered by County-provided data, Hillsborough Hack-A-Thon participants will flex their creative spirit and build applications that can benefit the community. The Hillsborough Hack-A-Thon is open to all college students and community designers and developers. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential impact of open data and technological development on the economic prosperity of our community.
